# IT542-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains implementations and testing of some of the basic pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms and concepts related to probability distribution and dispersion performed during the course *IT542 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* in M.Tech at DAIICT, Gandhinagar.

#### IRIS Dataset is used in some of the notebooks.

## Assignment 1
  - Plotting univariate and bivariate normal probability density functions
  - Implementing Central Limit Theorem

## Assignment 2
  - Implementing Bayes' Decision Rule classifier and classifying random numbers
  - All the apriori probs, conditional probs, etc are known

## Assignment 3
  - Implementing K Nearest Neighbours algorithm
  - Comparing classification results and accuracy on IRIS dataset with `sklearn`'s `KNearestNeighbours` function

## Assignment 4
  - Implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
  - Comparing classification results and accuracy on IRIS dataset with `sklearn`'s `GaussianNB` function

## Assignment 5
  - Implementing Kernel Density Estimation algorithm with a Gaussian Kernel
  - Testing KDE function on synthetically generated data of two normal distributions

## Assignment 6
  - Implementing K-Means algorithm for unsuprevised clustering.
  - Comparing cluster centroids found for IRIS dataset with that of `sklearn`'s `KMeans` function
